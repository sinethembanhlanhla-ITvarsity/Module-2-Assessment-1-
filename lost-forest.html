                    <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                    <P>The Lost Forest isn’t hard to find — it’s just hard to see. Tucked in among the trees and rocks at Elk Camp on Snowmass are an alpine coaster, biking trails, ropes challenges and a climbing wall. There are ponds to fish in, creeks to hike along and places to enjoy nature alone or with the whole family. Here, surrounded by wild beauty, you’ll find your next wild adventure. Welcome to Lost Forest.
Lost Forest offers adventures with safe distances between groups and minimal close interactions with guides, and all equipment is sterilized between uses.
