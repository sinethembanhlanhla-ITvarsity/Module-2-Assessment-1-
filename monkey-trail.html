    *Visitors cannot touch/feed.</p>
                    <h3>How long will it take?</h3>
<p>Most visitors spend a few hours within the monkey enclosure and are free to re-enter as many times as they wish during their trip. We’re currently limiting visits to 2 hours as part of our new guidelines.
The woodland walk is just less than a mile long and there are multiple information boards along the way. Knowledgeable guides are situated throughout the forest to help answer any questions you may have during your trip and to ensure the park rules are followed.
    Hourly feeding talks take place at quarter past each hour and are a must watch (currently only running Monday-Friday). It is always recommended to take your time around the forest, stopping to take pictures and take in the monkeys fascinating behaviour – they’re extremely entertaining to watch!Great family day out</p>

                    <h3>Where did it all begin?</h3> 
<p>140 monkeys living in Stoke on Trent? This unique idea first started back in 1969 when our first park was opened in France. Due to the success of the park, a second park was opened in Rocamadour, also in France. Later a third park opened in Germany in 1976.
In 2004 two groups of Barbary macaques from the existing parks were re-homed here in Trentham, and the park opened to the public in July 2005.
Unfortunately, Barbary macaques are listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to loss of habitat and the illegal pet trade.
Trentham Monkey Forest aims to provide visitors with a unique, interesting and educational experience, whilst raising awareness and informing you of our involvement in the conservation of the endangered wild Barbary macaques, and the research we do to help protect them.
We pride ourselves with being one of the most unique days out in Staffordshire, whilst doing everything we can to help these endangered monkeys.</p>
