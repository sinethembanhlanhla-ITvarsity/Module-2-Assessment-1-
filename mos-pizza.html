<P>Flavors That Are Sure To Impress
At Mo's Pizza, we use only the freshest ingredients on pizzas and other tasty offerings. We have created quite a following for our Traditional American New York Pizza. Our from-scratch pizza dough is made fresh each and every day, and our tantalizing pizza sauce will have you screaming for more. Let our extensive menu tease your taste buds. You can enjoy a single slice or build your own pizza with two choices of size, or you can indulge in one of our tempting house specialty pizzas. When you choose to build your own pizza, you can select from all the traditional toppings plus some others not so traditional such as spinach, sundried tomatoes, fresh garlic, artichoke hearts, and fresh basil. Our specialty pizzas include deluxe, vegetarian, meat lovers, margarita, barbecue chicken, and Mo's Special. Can't you just taste them already?
